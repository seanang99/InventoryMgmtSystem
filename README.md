# Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System (IMS) (Version 1) is a closet management system that stores, tracks and facilitates the movement of fashion and beauty samples. Samples are often circulated between stylists, photographers, editors and the store for publicity and photo/video opportunities. The limited number of samples often results in conflicts in scheduling and tracing.
